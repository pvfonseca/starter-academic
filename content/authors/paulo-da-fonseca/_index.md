I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) - Brazil. My dissertation is entitled “Three essays on monetary and fiscal policy interactions” and was supervised by Jaylson Jair da Silveira and [Guilherme Valle Moura](https://sites.google.com/site/guilhermevallemoura/).

My main research interests are in: Macroeconomics; Fiscal policy and monetary policy and its interactions; Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models; Heterogeneous agents New Keynesian models; Agent-based modeling.
